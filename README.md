# About this Project:
This project analyzes a dataset of 21,000+ records across 9 interrelated tables, simulating real-world business challenges within the Amazon ecosystem. It covers key domains like sales, customers, products, returns, payments, shipping, and inventory management. 

## Objective:
The primary objective of the project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex querries that address real world e-commerce bussiness challenges.The analysis cover various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behaviour
- Sales Trends
- Payment and Shipping Analysis
- Product Performance

# Project Overview:
This project involved building a comprehensive SQL database for an e-commerce platform similar to Amazon, aimed at analyzing sales, customer behavior, product trends, and monitoring inventory. The dataset includes multiple tables, each serving different aspects of the business:

## Dataset Overview:

- The project uses 9 tables: **Customers, Products, Categories, Sellers, Orders, Order Items, Shipping, Payments, and Inventory.**
- Relationships were established through **primary and foreign keys** to ensure data integrity and enable complex queries.

## Key Analytical Goals:

- Evaluate **sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance**.
- Monitor **inventory levels** to prevent stock shortages and optimize supply chain management.
- Analyze **customer returns and seller performance** to enhance operational efficiency.

## Database Design:

- The database mirrors Amazon's workflow with **parent-child relationships**, linking key tables like Customers, Sellers, and Orders.
- The design allows for thorough analysis of operations across various departments.

## Initial Setup & Data Import Process:

- Data was imported from **9 CSV files** into the Amazon_Db database, followed by adding **primary keys** and **foreign key constraints**.
- Attention was given to the integrity of the relationships between the tables, such as linking ** Products ↔ Categories** and **Orders ↔ Customers.**
**
## Skills Demonstrated:

- **Database Design & Integrity Management:** Ensured proper schema design, data integrity, and optimization of table structures.
- **Data Cleaning & Filtering**: Employed techniques like NULLIF() and COALESCE() for data cleaning and error handling.
- **Advanced Querying & Business Intelligence**: Used aggregations, window functions, and CTEs for complex analysis of sales, revenue, and customer trends.
- **Customer & Seller Performance Analysis:** Identified high-value customers and evaluated seller performance with rankings.
- **Sales & Revenue Insights:** Analyzed product sales, category contributions, return rates, and profit margins.
